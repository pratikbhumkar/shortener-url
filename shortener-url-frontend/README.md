# URL Shortener frontend

This is the frontend to the URL Shortener.
This app is built using React.js. It accepts a longURL and returns a shorter version.

### Known issues/Improvements
- The app currently only allows `longURLs` that start with `http` or `https` or `ftp`.
- Run the backend project first and run the front end on port `3001`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
